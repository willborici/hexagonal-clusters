In my consulting work, I elicit a lot of information, from challenges and
needs (often expressed as symptoms) to wishes and opinions. I have found the
hexagon technique (see https://thesystemsthinker.com/hexagons-from-ideas-to-variables/)
quite powerful in analyzing and synthesizing solutions and strategies.

The goal of this project is to build an interactive hexagonal clustering
product that can take elicited information as input and create hexagons for
the user to create clusters based on affinity or other criteria.

While all sorts of existing office tools can be used to draw hexagons and
play around with the layout, they are fairly static and, frankly, not appealing
to me -- thus this product that meets my needs (and, from experience, those
of other professionals who get annoyed by diagramming tools).

Here's a screenshot with demo data (initial working prototype):
